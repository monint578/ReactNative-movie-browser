# ReactNative Movie Browser

This is my first project built with React Native. It was developed for Android and wasn't tested for iOS. 

### Functionality
* Date is fetched from https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api
* Browse page: a preview of three movie lists sorted by different categories (popular, top rated, upcomming).
* Details page: a preview of a single movie and a related movies tab for the selected movie.
* The Details page contains a button for playing the movie's trailer.

## Building the App
* npm install
* npx react-native start
* npx react-native run-android
